# Scallop stable isotopes

## Overview

This repository contains code and data related to a study on how growing conditions influence diet in scallop aquaculture and fisheries. Additional data and information is available from the Hurricane Island research team.

## Getting started

The analysis methods use Python and Pixi to output `figures` and tables from the `data`. The Python dependencies are defined in `pixi.toml`.

The most basic use case is to generate all figures by running `pixi run python main.py` on the command line. 

## Disclosure of Generative AI use
